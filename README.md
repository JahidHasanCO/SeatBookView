For creating a seat system you have to create a String for your seat position.
```kotlin
    private var seats = (
            "/U___S" +
                    "/_____" +
                    "/AA_AA" +
                    "/UA_AR" +
                    "/AA_AA" +
                    "/RU_AA" +
                    "/AA_AR" +
                    "/AU_AA" +
                    "/AA_AA" +
                    "/AAAAA"
            )
```

For setting the custom title of a seat, you need to create an ArrayList and set the value by index (You need to add value the same as your seat plan).
```kotlin
    private var title = listOf(
        "/", "I1", "", "", "", "E5",
        "/", "", "", "", "", "",
        "/", "A1", "A2", "", "A3", "A4",
        "/", "B1", "B2", "", "B2", "B4",
        "/", "C1", "C2", "", "C3", "C4",
        "/", "D1", "D2", "", "D3", "D4",
        "/", "E1", "E2", "", "E3", "E4",
        "/", "F1", "F2", "", "F3", "F4",
        "/", "G1", "G2", "", "G3", "G4",
        "/", "H1", "H2", "H3", "H4", "H5"
    )
```

    viewGroupLayout = findViewById(R.id.layoutSeat)
    seatBookView = SeatBookView(this)
        .setSeatGaping(5)
        .setSeatSizeBySeatsColumn(6)
        .setSeatsLayoutString(seats)
        .isCustomTitle(true)
        .setCustomTitle(title)
        .setSelectSeatLimit(2)
        
    seatBookView.setSeatViewLayout(viewGroupLayout)
